        email = st.text_input("Email")
        phone = st.text_input("Phone Number")
        booking_date = st.date_input("Booking Date")
        booking_time = st.time_input("Booking Time")
        message = st.text_area("Additional Message")

        submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit Booking")

        if submitted:
            # Generate WhatsApp link
            whatsapp_message = (
                f"Name: {name}\nEmail: {email}\nPhone: {phone}\n"
                f"Date: {booking_date}\nTime: {booking_time}\nMessage: {message}"
            )
            encoded_message = urllib.parse.quote(whatsapp_message)
